# Image_Recognition_With_IBM_Cloud
PROJECT TECHNOLOGY- CLOUD APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT NAME: IMAGE RECOGNITION WITH IBM CLOUD
STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:

Sign In to IBM Cloud:
Log in to your IBM Cloud account using your credentials.

Access the Visual Recognition Service:
Navigate to the IBM Cloud Dashboard.

Create or Select a Visual Recognition Service:
If you haven't already created a Visual Recognition service, you can create a new resource by clicking "Create Resource" or "Create Service."

Configure the Service:
Set up your Visual Recognition service by choosing a service plan (e.g., "Lite" plan) and giving it a name. Follow the prompts to create the service.

Retrieve API Key and Endpoint:
After creating the service, go to the service instance in your IBM Cloud Dashboard.

Upload the Image:
Within the service, you can typically find an option to upload an image. This could be part of the service's user interface or through an API call.

Choose the Image:

Select the image you want to upload from your local device.

Initiate Image Recognition:
Once the image is uploaded, you may need to initiate image recognition through the service. This could be done automatically or through a specific API request.

Retrieve Recognition Results:
The Visual Recognition service will process the image and provide recognition results, which may include labels, captions, or other information related to the image.

View or Use the Results:
You can view and use the recognition results as needed for your application, whether displaying them to the user or using them for further processing.
